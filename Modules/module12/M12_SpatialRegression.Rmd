# 1. Data

We'll be using a commonly reference data set for exploring and learning spatial regression. The lip cancer case data among Males in Scotland counties from 1975 to 1980. We will use this data to assess patterns in the standardized incidence ratios (SIR), for cancer clustering, and estimate the risk of lip cancer relative to the proportion of the population in agriculture, fishing, or forestry (AFF), which is a risk factor for lip cancer given the increased exposure to sun light.

```{r}
# load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)

# the following code reads in the zip file from github with the scottish lip cancer shapefile
t1 <- tempfile()
t2 <- tempfile()
scotlip <- download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rsnead91/EPBI_5003/main/Modules/module12/scotlip.zip",t1)
unzip(zipfile = t1, exdir = t2)
scotlip <- st_read(t2)

# review the data types
str(scotlip)

# review the raw data
head(scotlip)
```

The variables included in the data are:

|           |                                              |
|:----------|:---------------------------------------------|
| CODENO    | Code converted to numeric (drop w prefix)    |
| AREA      | District polygon area                        |
| PERIMETER | District polygon perimeter                   |
| RECORD_ID | Unique ID                                    |
| DISTRICT  | District number 1-56                         |
| NAME      | Name of districts from Cressie (1993)        |
| CODE      | District code from WinBugs                   |
| CANCER    | Lip cancer cases from Cressie (1993)         |
| POP       | Population years at risk from Cressie (1993) |
| CEXP      | Expected cases from Lawson et al. (1999)     |
| AFF       | Outdoor industry from Lawson et al. (1999)   |

First we'll run a ggplot to make sure the projection looks right. Then, we will perform a simple exploratory analysis/quality check by calculating descriptive statistics and mapping the population, observed, expected, and % AFF.

```{r}
# take a look at the study area
# the crs code is set to ESPG 27700, the projection for OSGB 1936/British National Grid, which is commonly used for the UK
# you could find the crs by simply running: st_crs(scotlip)
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = scotlip)

# using the summary function to return descriptive statistics on the subset numeric data
summary(scotlip[,c("POP","CANCER","CEXP","AFF")])

# mapping variables of interest

# population
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = scotlip, aes(fill = POP))

# observed cancer cases
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = scotlip, aes(fill = CANCER))

# expected cancer cases
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = scotlip, aes(fill = CEXP))

# proportion of county in an outdoor industry
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = scotlip, aes(fill = AFF))

```

After reviewing the descriptives, what patterns are you starting to notice?

Now let's calculate the SIR and map the results.

```{r}
# create a new variable for SIR by dividing the observed by expected # of cases
scotlip$SIR <- scotlip$CANCER / scotlip$CEXP

# review new SIR variable
print(scotlip[,c("CANCER","CEXP","SIR")])

# map SIRs
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = scotlip, aes(fill = SIR)) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "blue", mid = "white", high = "red", midpoint = 1) +
  theme_void()


```

What are your thoughts about the patterns of the SIR for lip cancer? How do they differ or affirm your thoughts from reviewing the previous descriptives?

# 2. Spatial weights matrices

In order to start performing tests and running regressions, we need to set up our spatial weights matrix, or neighborhood matrix.

The objects and functions used for identifying neighbors and creating weights are mainly from the [**spdep**](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/index.html) package. Depending on the spatial analysis and packages you are using, you may need your neighbor files or weights matrix in various object types, such as nb, list, or matrix.

## 2.1 Contiguity

To create a create a queen or rook contiguity neighbors file we can use `poly2nb()`, which takes out shapefile of polygons and identifies bordering neighbors. Weights are assigned as 1 for neighboring polygons and 0 for non-neighboring polygons.

```{r}
#install.packages("spdep)
library(spdep)

# create nb object for scotland county polygons
# 'queen = TRUE' tells R we want to use queen rather than rook contiguity. For rook, use 'queen = FALSE'
#?poly2nb
scot_nb <- poly2nb(scotlip, queen = TRUE)

# reviewing assigned neighbors
plot(st_geometry(scotlip), border = "grey")
plot(scot_nb, st_geometry(scotlip), add = TRUE)

```

Each line connecting from one circle to another represents a neighbor connection. Notice the islands are not connected and the northern counties don't have many neighbors. How do you think that might effect regression estimates?

## 2.2 Distance-based

Contiguity neighbors and binary weights are simple to create but are not usually as accurate for regression analyses. Alternatively, we can calcuate distance-based weights, such as k-nearest-neighbors (knn) and inverse distance weighting.

**knn based on the number of nearest neighbors:**

```{r}
# use centroids rather than polygons for knn
centroids <- st_centroid(scotlip)

# create neighbor file for nearest 5 neighbors
#?knearneigh
#?knn2nb
nb_5 <- knn2nb(knearneigh(centroids, k  = 5))

# reviewing knn = 5 neighbors
plot(st_geometry(scotlip), border = "grey")
plot(nb_5, st_geometry(scotlip), add = TRUE)

```

Now the islands are connected to mainland Scotland and some neighbors from the north are connected to counties relatively far away. How might you modify the weights specification?

NOTE: If you use knn, you need to link the data from the centroids to the original polygons and also force symmetry in the weights matrix, `knn2nb(sym = TRUE)`, for the regression to run.

**knn based on distance to neighbors:**

```{r}
# assigning neighbors based on distance between county centroids
# d1 = lower bound for distance in km, d2 = upper bound for distance in km

# finding the maximum distance that any centroid is from another to ensure all counties have at least 1 neighbor
#?nbdists
#?unlist
#?max
max_dist <- max(unlist(nbdists(knn2nb(knearneigh(centroids)), centroids)))
max_dist

#?dnearneigh
nb_d <- dnearneigh(centroids, d1 = 0, d2 = max_dist)

# reviewing knn neighbors up to 10km away
plot(st_geometry(scotlip), border = "grey")
plot(nb_d, st_geometry(scotlip), add = TRUE)

```

How do you compare the contiguity and knn neighbors? Which do you think is more appropriate for our data?

**Inverse Distance Weighting:**

```{r}

```

8.3 Neighbor weights matrix

```         

# binary
nb <- poly2nb(map, queen = TRUE)
nbw <- spdep::nb2listw(nb, style = "W")
nbw$weights[1:3]

m1 <- listw2mat(nbw)
lattice::levelplot(t(m1),
scales = list(y = list(at = c(10, 20, 30, 40),
                       labels = c(10 20, 30, 40))))

# idw
coo <- st_centroid(map)
nb <- poly2nb(map, queen = TRUE)
dists <- nbdists(nb, coo)
ids <- lapply(dists, function(x){1/x})

nbw <- nb2listw(nb, glist = ids, style = "B")
nbw$weights[1:3]

m2 <- listw2mat(nbw)
lattice::levelplot(t(m2),
scales = list(y = list(at = c(10, 20, 30, 40),
                       labels = c(10, 20, 30, 40))))
```

# 3. Spatial autocorrelation

Moran's I

## 3.1 Global

```         
# Neighbors
library(spdep)
nb <- poly2nb(map, queen = TRUE) # queen shares point or border
nbw <- nb2listw(nb, style = "W")

# Global Moran's I
gmoran <- moran.test(map$vble, nbw,
                     alternative = "greater")
gmoran

gmoran[["estimate"]][["Moran I statistic"]] # Moran's I
gmoran[["statistic"]] # z-score
gmoran[["p.value"]] # p-value
```

## 3.2 Local

\- give a sense of what to expect?

-   `Ii`: Local Moran's I� statistic for each area,

-   `E.Ii`: Expectation Local Moran's I� statistic,

-   `Var.Ii`: Variance Local Moran's I� statistic,

-   `Z.Ii`: z-score,

-   `Pr(z > E(Ii))`, `Pr(z < E(Ii))` or `Pr(z != E(Ii))`: p-value for an alternative hypothesis `greater`, `less` or `two.sided`, respectively."

```         
lmoran <- localmoran(map$vble, nbw, alternative = "greater")
head(lmoran)

tm_shape(map) + tm_fill(col = "quadrant", title = "",
breaks = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
palette =  c("red", "blue", "lightpink", "skyblue2", "white"),
labels = c("High-High", "Low-Low", "High-Low",
           "Low-High", "Non-significant")) +
tm_legend(text.size = 1)  + tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
tm_layout(frame = FALSE,  title = "Clusters")  +
tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE)
